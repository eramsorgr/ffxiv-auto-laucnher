Tired of writting your password or (like me) copying it from your autofill service? Well this tool is for you.

⭐ Like the project? Please star it! 💜⭐


### WARNING 
Please note that this tool is **NOT** safe! Why? Because you are storing your password in a text file. 
Yes yes I know, some people do that but it's not safe and I have to warn you. 
I recommend generating a complete random password using a password manager so that incase someone opens the file, your other accounts wont be harmed. 
*Please keep in mind that viruses that can steal the file will also have access to this password.*
Bookmark this page https://secure.square-enix.com/account/app/svc/mbrPasswd to change your password in a breach. 
(Alternative visit https://secure.square-enix.com > Account > Account Information > Confirm bday > Update account information (all the way down) > Update Password) 

### How to use
Download this tool, put it on desktop or somewhere, edit the 3rd line "Password" field and enter your password inside the two quotation marks
Example: 
`pwd = "mysecurepassword"`

Run the file!
